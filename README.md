Tasks to be Accomplished

    Integrating SQLAlchemy:
        Modify the application to include SQLAlchemy, setting up models to interact with a database while keeping the option for file-based persistence.
        Ensure that all models are correctly transformed into SQLAlchemy ORM-compatible classes.
        Configure SQLAlchemy to connect to a SQLite database for development purposes.

    Configurable Database Selection:
        Implement a configuration system that allows the application to toggle between using SQLite for development and a more robust database like PostgreSQL for production.
        Ensure the application can dynamically choose the database type based on environment settings or configuration files.

    Implementing Authentication with JWT:
        Integrate Flask-JWT-Extended to add secure authentication mechanisms to the API.
        Create endpoints for user authentication that issue JWTs and use these tokens to control access to various API endpoints.

    Database Schema Design and Migration:
        Design a database schema that accurately represents the data relationships and business rules.
        Create the SQL scripts for your database structure. Optionally, use tools like Alembic to manage database migrations.

    Role-Based Access Control:
        Modify existing API endpoints to incorporate checks for user roles and permissions, restricting certain actions to authenticated users or administrators.

    Docker Integration:
        Update the Docker configuration to support the new database and authentication functionalities.
        Ensure that the Docker environment is configured to handle different database types and authentication services.
